My name is Tomas Vaedelund and I live just outside of Växjö, Sweden. I'm taking the program Webbprogrammerare at
Linnaeus University and this site is a part of one of the courses. Here I'll blog about my progress and in the protfolio
you will be able to see some of my creations.

I'm taking the program att half speed since I'm also working full time. Sometimes this is a challenge but it's also
another opportunity to learn how to prioritize and focus. In my work I often write programs, small and large. It can be
small ones that solves a specific customer need or it can be a larger programs. The biggest project I was in was when we
got 14 new customers in the same deal and had to convert their old data to our data format.

In my spare time, that little I have, I enjoy brewing and drinking beer. It's not about the number of beers but instead
about slowly enjoying an exclusive IPA, Stout or one of my own creations. Lately though Belgian style beers has been in
focus.
