The site is finished! ish... Some more tweaks to do before I am 100% satisfied but it's a pre-release.

TODOs that is done:

1. "Read more" after posts in the index.html not working. - They are now!
2. Pagination... Is it worth it? - YES!

TODO:

1. I need to fill the other pages like About and probably need to add some more pages
2. Some css tweaks is left but they are small
3. The texts should reflect what is actually on the site
