I'm pleased how this turned out. Simplistic and clean, just the way I like it. Only thing left now is to reflect about
what I have learned. But before that I'll make a list of some of the additions I have made that was not a part of the assignment:

* Post preview - See the first 40 words of each post. If there is more than 40 words in the post you'll also see a Read more link.
* Pagination - One page only contains max 4 blog posts. In the bottom of the page there is a navigation to Older posts.
* Font Awesome - Less images and more text. Less Images makes for less requests. This is used in the footer to display contact alternatives.
