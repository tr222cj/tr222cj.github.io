Finally the CSS is mostly done. I have done 99% of the header and the body. Left is only the footer. There have been som other changes to.

1. Preview of post
2. Started experimenting with pagination but I had to remove that again. Let's see if it comes back
3. Readability: This is a part of CSS but hey it's worth mentioning
4. Still a bit confused about the menu... Should it be on top? It wont fit if there is to many links there but I don't want to move it. Perhaps show "hamburger" sooner?

TODO:

1. "Read more..." after posts in the index.html not working.
2. Pagination... Is it worth it?
